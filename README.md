# README.md - circuitpython express matrix 8x8 display

circuitpython project that uses a 8x8 led matrix and some simple animations.  Mostly followed the design from below link, that has the fusion 360 files for the enclosures and the instructions for circuitpythion.  

that project uses the huzzaz board that has more memory. my huzzaz board was old and didn't have SPI, so i used a circuit python express board (SAMD2).  it works but is limited in memory so i couldn't do the animation i wanted, but i found another one that looked nice.

the 3d printing was very nice... I have a Crealty Ender 3d, and i used PLA for the material.  I didn't have the acrylic diffuser, nor did i have any laser cutters, so i just printed the diffuser with PLA and used that.  It worked pretty well, the diffuser does have some infil patterns that are visible, but they look nice.
